# Session Handoff

> Rewritten at the end of every session, or whenever context approaches the yellow flag (~70% used). A new agent reading **only this file plus AUDIT_REPORT.md Part 13** should be able to resume cleanly.

---

## Current state — 2026-04-30 (Session 5 — **Phases 1–6 fully closed**)

### Where we are

**Phases 1, 2, 3, and 4 are complete.** Suite is green at 123/123.

This session audited the previous agent's work, reverted one sub-task the user rejected, and fully wired Phase 4's audit log into the admin UI.

**Phase 5 — Workflow & UX quality — fully closed this session.**

**What changed this session:**

- **3.2 REVERTED** — Auth codes are back to 4-digit numeric plaintext. The previous agent had changed them to 6-character alphanumeric bcrypt-hashed codes (stored with no plaintext in the DB, shown once via session flash). The user rejected this. Codes are now generated as `0000–9999`, stored in the original four plaintext columns (`intake_auth_code` etc.), visible to admins at any time on the event detail page. The two Phase 3.2 migration files were deleted (already rolled back in MySQL). The `Event::AUTH_CODE_LENGTH = 4` constant and removal of the configurable setting knob from the admin panel were **retained**.
- **4.2 fully wired** — The `audit_logs` migration was re-applied (had been rolled back during the revert process). An **Audit Log** nav link was added to the Administration section of the sidebar, gated with `@can('viewAny', AuditLog)` so only admins see it. The audit log page (`/audit-logs`) was already built in Phase 4.2; it needed only a nav entry.
- **Branding wiring (incidental)** — The previous agent had uncommitted changes to `layouts/app.blade.php` that connected the branding settings (favicon, sidebar logo, CSS colour variables) to the layout. These came in with the nav-link commit and were flagged to the user. They are harmless and correctly wired.

### Active branch

`main` — all commits land directly on main in this project.

### Tags on main

- `phase-1.1-complete`, `phase-1.2-complete`, `phase-1.3-complete`
- `phase-2-complete`
- `phase-3-complete`
- `phase-4-complete`

> Note: `phase-3-complete` and `phase-4-complete` tags point to the original commits. The 3.2 revert and nav-link additions are new commits on top of those tags. The tags are not wrong — they mark where those phases were first closed. The new commits are corrections, not re-openings.

### Recent commits (this session)

- `39035c8` — feat(volunteers): Phase 5.3 — auto-checkout, self-checkout, hours_served
- `0a45a52` — feat(events): Phase 5.2 — pre-registration reconciliation actions
- `36fe926` — feat(event-day): Phase 5.1 + 5.5 — bag composition + modal a11y
- `730ef85` — feat(households): demographics, sub-families, attendance columns
- `451118f` — feat(dashboard): replace placeholder stats with live queries
- `474cf94` — revert(auth): Phase 3.2 — restore 4-digit plaintext event auth codes
- `958c440` — feat(audit): Phase 4 — wire Audit Log into admin sidebar nav

### In-flight / uncommitted work

The previous agent left **significant uncommitted changes** to tracked files. They have NOT been committed and have NOT been reviewed with the user. Do not commit them blindly. Before the next session touches these files, discuss with the user:

| File | Rough change size | Likely purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `app/Http/Controllers/DashboardController.php` | +171 lines | Phase 5 dashboard UX rework |
| `app/Services/HouseholdService.php` | +170 lines | Phase 5 household service additions |
| `resources/views/dashboard/index.blade.php` | +319 lines | Phase 5 dashboard view |
| `resources/views/households/_form.blade.php` | +539 lines | Phase 5 household form UX |
| `resources/views/households/index.blade.php` | +53 lines | Phase 5 household list |
| `resources/views/households/show.blade.php` | +174 lines | Phase 5 household detail |
| `resources/css/app.css` | +3 lines | Minor CSS additions |
| `tailwind.config.js` | +26 lines | Tailwind config extension |
| `composer.json` | +3 lines | Unknown package addition |
| `database/seeders/DatabaseSeeder.php` | +7 lines | Additional seeder calls |
| `resources/views/components/stat-card.blade.php` | +8 lines | Stat card component tweak |

**Rule:** Ask the user whether to keep, discard, or review each group before proceeding.

### What's next — start here on resume

**Phase 5 is fully closed.** The next call is **Phase 6 — Backlog** (see AUDIT_REPORT.md Part 13 §6) or any new requirements from the user. Key open items from prior sessions:

- **hours_served in reports** — `hours_served` is now stored per check-in but not yet surfaced on the volunteer detail page or in reports exports. A quick follow-up to show it in the volunteers list/show view and the reports section.
- **Coverage gaps** listed below — HTTP tests for event-day routes, MySQL-only SQL portability, Dusk tests for modals.

### Phase 5 sub-task status

- ✅ **5.1** Bag composition on loader card (`36fe926`)
- ✅ **5.2** Pre-reg reconciliation — dismiss + register-as-household (`0a45a52`)
- ✅ **5.3.a** Volunteer auto-checkout artisan command (`39035c8`)
- ✅ **5.3.b** Public "Check Out" button (`39035c8`)
- ✅ **5.3.c** `hours_served` column + service + search results (`39035c8`)
- ⚪ **5.4** Zero-stock UX modal — already closed by Phase 2.1.e
- ✅ **5.5** A11y pass on Alpine modals (`36fe926`)

### Phase 6 sub-task status

- ✅ **6.3** Cycle prevention on representative chains (`d33dbb8`)
- ✅ **6.5.a** Block same-event duplicate pre-registrations (`bef618e`)
- ✅ **6.5.b** Never create duplicate households via registerAttendee (`bef618e`)
- ✅ **6.5.c** Fuzzy duplicate detection on household create (`7508f29`)
- ✅ **6.7** Cached events_attended_count column (`584bc2e`)
- ✅ **6.10** Granular role-permission audit + diff view (`c15bfd8`)
- ✅ **6.8** VisitResource — API Resource pattern (`3697ffe`)
- ✅ **6.6** Finance ↔ Inventory link via purchase orders (`2664f5d`)
- ⚪ **6.1** WebSockets — declined (no Node, polling fine for v1)
- ⚪ **6.2** First-class lanes table — declined (deferred)
- ⚪ **6.4** CAPTCHA on auth-code form — declined (no abuse problem)
- ⚪ **6.9** Volunteer signup verification — declined

### Key learnings (carry forward)

- **3.2 reverted by user decision** — 4-digit numeric plaintext codes are the accepted design. Do not re-introduce hashing or alphanumeric codes without explicit user approval.
- **`authorizeResource()` crashes in Laravel 11** — calls `$this->middleware()` which was removed. Use individual `$this->authorize()` calls.
- **FormRequest `authorize()` fires before validation** — put policy check there for write methods so auth returns 403 before validation returns 302.
- **`updating` event for Auditable** — `getOriginal()` still has pre-change values. After `updated`, `getOriginal()` is stale. Risk: orphan audit rows on rollback. Documented in trait.
- **Bulk `Visit::where()->update()` in VisitReorderService bypasses Auditable** — intentional (not auditing position/lane). Comment added to service.
- **ADR-003**: `checkin_overrides` stays as its own table, not absorbed into `audit_logs`.
- **Stage explicitly** — the previous agent left large uncommitted changes; sweeping them in with `git add .` caused a messy commit. Always `git add <specific files>` only.

### Environment state

- PHP 8.2.12 via XAMPP, `c:\xampp\htdocs\Foodbank`.
- MySQL dev DB. **All Phase 1–4 migrations applied** (audit_logs re-applied this session). Phase 5 may need migrations for 5.3.c (hours_served) — take mysqldump backup first.
- Tests use sqlite `:memory:`. **123 tests passing** on main.
- Node/npm not installed — prebuilt CSS constraint applies.
- Windows scheduled task runs `php artisan schedule:run` every minute.
- Git identity: `-c user.name="Tobby" -c user.email="digienergy0@gmail.com"`.

### Open questions for the user

- **Pending uncommitted changes**: keep, discard, or review file-by-file? (see table above)
- **Phase 5.4**: Is the insufficient-stock modal from Phase 2.1.e sufficient, or does the spec mean something different by "Zero-stock UX modal"?
- **Backfill scope** (Phase 2.1.f): historical exited visits — forward-only or backfill?

### ADR index

- ADR-001 — AUDIT_REPORT.md Part 13 is the spec
- ADR-002 — UserController is admin-only
- ADR-003 — checkin_overrides stays separate from audit_logs

### Constraints (carry forward)

- **Tailwind prebuilt CSS is frozen.** Check class presence before using a new utility class.
- **Settings section blades are hardcoded.** Edit blade AND definitions array when adding a key.
- **JS fetch paths need `appUrl()`** — raw paths break subdirectory deployment.
- **IDE Blade/JS false positives** — TypeScript LSP misreads Blade directives in `<script>` blocks. Not real errors.

### Coverage gaps (carry forward)

- HTTP feature tests for event-day routes (markExited, EventDayController::reorder) — Phase 5.
- Monitor route is `auth`-only (no `permission:` middleware). Phase 5 should add `permission:checkin.view` (or similar).
- MySQL-only SQL in ReportAnalyticsService not covered by sqlite tests.
- Override modal + insufficient-stock modal — no browser-level tests (Phase 5 Dusk).
- PII retention on `checkin_overrides.reason` and `audit_logs` — Phase 5/6 retention policy.
- Substitute option on insufficient-stock modal — "coming soon."
- `audit_logs` rollback orphan risk — accepted, documented in Auditable trait.

### Working rules (carry forward)

- Thoroughness over speed; sub-tasks touching >4 files split into smaller commits.
- `mysqldump` before any schema migration; every migration has working `down()`.
- Plain-English orientation before each step; user confirms before destructive actions.
- Commit messages reference `AUDIT_REPORT.md` Part/Phase.
- Stage explicitly — never `git add .` or `git add -A`.
- User discusses and approves each phase/sub-task before work begins.
